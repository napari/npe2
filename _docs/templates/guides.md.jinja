## Readers

Reader plugins may add support for new filetypes to napari.
They are invoked whenever `viewer.open('some/path')` is used on the
command line, or when a user opens a file in the graphical user interface by
dropping a file into the canvas, or using `File -> Open...`

The `command` provided by a reader contribution is expected to be a function
that accepts a path or a sequence of paths and either returns `None` (if it
does not want to accept the given path) or returns a *new function*
(a `ReaderFunction`) that is capable of doing the reading.

The `ReaderFunction` will be passed the same path (or list of paths) and
is expected to return a list of [`LayerData`]().

```{admonition} Accepting directories
A reader may indicate that it accepts directories by
setting `contributions.readers.<reader>.accepts_directories` to `True`;
otherwise, they will not be invoked when a directory is passed to `viewer.open`.
```

### example implementation

```python
# example_plugin.some_module

{{ specs.ReaderContribution }}
```
{%- for contrib in contributions -%}
{% if contrib.name == 'readers' %}
### example manifest

See [reader contribution reference](./contributions.html#contributions-readers)
for field details.

```yaml
{{contrib.example}}
```
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
