# Plugins

Plugins allow developers to customize and extend napari.

This document describes:

- How to [build, run and publish a plugin](how-to-build-a-plugin).
- Where to find [guides](./guides) and code samples to help get you started.
- [Guidelines](./best-practices) for writing plugins.

If you are looking for published plugins, head to the [napari hub][napari_hub].


```{admonition} Introducing npe2
:class: important
We introduced a new plugin engine ([`npe2`][npe2]) in December 2021.

Plugins targeting `napari-plugin-engine` will continue to work for at least the first half of 2022, but we recommend migrating to `npe2`. See the [migration
guide](npe2-migration-guide) for details.

For a guide on how to create a plugin using `napari-plugin-engine`, see
{ref}`plugins-for-plugin-developers`. For _hook specifications_ reference,
see the {ref}`hook-specifications-reference`.
```

## What can plugins do?

- Add file format support with **readers** and **writers**
- Add custom **widgets** and user interface elements
- Provide **sample data**
- Change the look of napari with a color **theme**
